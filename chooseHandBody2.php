    <p>
    Some of the most powerful starting hands in poker. But the power only lasts  
    so long. The more players still in the higher the chance someone pulls a hand 
    stronger than your high pair.

        <h3>Pre Flop</h3>
            <p>
            Look to bet high before the flop 
            and force out as many players as you can.
            You should be the one in the driver seat when it comes to raising.
            If you hand is particularly high i.e Aces or Kings no one has anything that can beat you prior to the flop so 
            continue to raise until you no longer have the opportunity.
            </p>

                <h3>After the flop</h3>
                
                <p>  
                If you managed to pull either three of a kind or a full house, look to continue to bet hard, 
                it’s smooth sailing from here. Now it’s about maximising profit.
                </p>
              
                <p>
                If you did not pull triples you want to try and read the table.
                Watch your opponents move if you haven’t been already. The chances of them pulling something on the flop that can beat
                your hand is still very slim if you have an exceptionally high pair. 
                </p>
                <p>
                If your pair is mid-high range i.e J-Q you may need to play very passive at this point.
                The chances of them pulling a better pair than you is quite high. Look at the board to see if your pair is the highest possible on the table.

                        Continue to try and gauge what your opponent has. 
                        If the cards on the table have high potential to beat yours do not be afraid to fold. 
                        You need to be willing to lose some chips in order to save your stack.

            This hand has high potential to pull out 3 of a kind on the flop. This type of a 
            three of a kind is known as a “set”. Don’t be afraid to call some high raises before the flop and also don’t be afraid to raise to scare people out. 
            You must remember that pocket pair have the highest probability of winning any given hand of poker.

                This either went one of two ways: either you tripled up or you didn’t.
                </p>
                <p>
                If you tripled up this is your time to shine. 
                A hidden set is a very powerful hand and a great way to snatch large amounts of chips. 
                People are less likely to suspect a three of a kind when the pair is in the hand. 
                So you can bet as hard as you like or play it slower in order to lure some people in, 
                this depends on your style of poker and your opponents.
                </p>
                <p>
                If you didn’t triple up it’s time to run. 
                If you can see the next card for free by all means do it, 
                but, as soon as you see a raise throw those cards in the trash. 
                Sometimes you gotta spend money to make money.

      <h3>Connectors</h3>
      
      <p>A connector is a pair of cards that are within 5 cards of each other or in other words could be part of a straight together.</p>
      
        <p>
        The strength of this hand depends on how close they are.
	If your cards are directly adjacent you have much higher chance of getting the 
        straight somewhere down the line. But even then your chances are low.

            <p>  A high connected pair could turn into one of the strongest hands in poker. </p>
            <h3>suited?</h3>
            <p> 
            2nd thing 2nd. Are they suited? If no you really shouldn’t play this hand. You may 
            want to stick around to see the flop if you were big blind. Otherwise throw them away.
            Even if they are suited you really don’t have a high chance of pulling either the flush
            or the straight. You shouldn’t be afraid to fold this hand especially early game. Later in the game 
            play these hands carefully. You don’t want to be calling any large raises and you really shouldn’t be raising anything.
            What is important to know is that if you hit this and you get the cards needed for the straight or the flush you should be in the money. 
            This can be one of the most valuable hands in poker.

            What we were looking for here was hopefully getting a pair of your low card or aces to come out in the flop giving you three of that card, 
            and the extra card in the flop to pair up your remaining card 
            Giving you a full house. If you did not get this proceed very carefully.

                Even if you get the ace, do not get into a bidding war. 
                The chance that someone also has the pair and then a higher kicker than you is quite likely.
                If the Ace comes and someone else plays strong it’s time to back down.

        Suited cards are the most overrated and overplayed hand by new players. What

        Having suited cards should be seen as a little bonus. 
        You should play the hand as usual i.e are they within 5 of each other. 
        How high are the face values of your cards. 
        If you play this way you are safe from over pushing on the low potential of a flush and you still have the ability to get a flush.

                <h3>Manage To Get The Flush</h3>

                <p>
                Because the odds of a flush are so low not many people expect you to pull a flush. 
                You have power in the element of surprise. 
                Most often against lower experience players if you push hard on a flush they will call you as they will think you are bluffing. 
                Or if you play it slow they won’t think you have the flush either. 
                How you play this is up to your own personal play style.
